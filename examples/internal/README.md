## Internal Package

This is a package private to `dgrpc/examples` and is used to contain stuff that you should not depends on. They are simply meant to make the examples leaner.

In your own code, you should replace usage of this package by reference to your own Protobuf definitions, gRPC services definitions and implementations.

## Balancing Examples

This example is actually more a test tool that we use for testing different gRPC behaviors at scales. It still serves as a good example for proper configuration of gRPC discovery service which `dgrpc` makes a little bit easier. It also shows communication between a client and a server in different terminals.

The example is made is such way that it's possible to start either a client or a server.
